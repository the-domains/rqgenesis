**WE GUIDE LEADERS TO CREATE INTEGRATED SUSTAINABLE VALUE IN EXPONENTIAL TIMES.**

"History is governed by those overarching movements that give shape and meaning to life by relating the human venture to the larger destinies of the Universe. The success or failure of any historical age is the extent to which those living at that time have fulfilled the special role that history has imposed upon them. The Great Work of now is to carry out the transition from a period of human devastation of the Earth to a period when humans would be present to the planet in a mutually beneficial manner." ~ _Thomas Berry, The Great Work_

This **'Great Work'** requires individual and collective transformation which is unprecedented in scale, magnitude and complexity. The solutions that enabled us to reach the current development level of our civilisation are not sufficient for the leap which lies ahead. We guide leaders to evolve into the next level of development enabling them to navigate the complexity of our times and to create sustainable value integrated in the core business.

3 KEY TRENDS THAT COMBINE TO MAKE OUR AGE A UNIQUE TIME IN HUMAN HISTORY

1. **Exponential Times** - The speed of change that organisations face today is exponential, not linear. Many industries are being completely transformed by rapidly accelerating technological trends leaving former industry leaders way behind and opening room for surprising new winners. **Exponential technologies** will re-shape our society in the years to come as well as significantly re-model the corporate landscape. Adapting to this pace of change requires organisations and their leaders to radically rethink their strategy and demands new and radical approaches to maintain competitiveness.
2. **Evolution of Sustainability** - During Rio+20, the last UN Conference on Sustainable Development, corporate representatives committed $500 billion to execute sustainability initiatives. It is clear that sustainability is moving from marginal consideration into the very core of business strategy, enabling easier access to capital, sustained business performance and lower business risk. **'Integrated Sustainability'** is a next evolutionary step after sustainability understood through the lens of **compliance**, **volunteering** (based on economic benefits) and stakeholder **partnerships**.
3. **Integral Leadership** - Developmental psychologists (Graves, Torbert, Keegan, Wilber, Cook-Greuter) all outline a completely new leadership paradigm which has been demostrated by successful leaders in all sectors of society. According to the research, about **4-5%** of the worldwide adult population is currently living from this paradigm, benefiting from unheard levels of performance, radical inclusiveness and ability to re-frame difficult problems. They are able to see what no one else sees and to integrate seemingly opposing forces to design breakthrough products, solutions and entire organisations.
