      Possibly more than any other single factor, your mindset determines your
      success. What you think is what you become. Internal dialogue--the ongoing
      conversation we all have with our mindset--is the driving force behind

      who you are and who you want to be stems from your mindset.

  Digital business models are a bit of a misnomer. It's not digital technology
  that defines them; it's their ability to create exponential value. The music
  and video industries, for example, weren't redefined by converting analog to
  digital formats. Just ask Sony about Minidisc players and Netflix about their
  DVD business.
