**WHAT**

OUR PROGRAMMES INTEGRATE VERTICAL LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT AND SYSTEMIC INNOVATION TO CREATE INTEGRATED SUSTAINABLE VALUE ALIGNED WITH LIFE.

1. **Vertical Development** - Traditional leadership development is horizontal - it develops new skills and behaviours within an already existing leadership paradigm. But to develop new paradigms, we need a development approach which is vertical. We specialize in helping leaders holistically assess, envision and develop radically new capacities towards a full embodiment of needed **'RQ'** capacities.
2. **RQ Genesis flow** is a **3-step process** to experience, develop and demonstrate full range of **'RQ'** capacities. Our first programme called **Exponential Leader **allows to **Experience** the power of the new leadership paradigm by creating tangible results and new lasting habits. The **RQ Genesis Innovation** programme fully develops all '**RQ'** capacities and guides leaders through an innovation process within their organisation to create integrated sustainable value aligned with life
3. **Our Toolkit** - We have over 20 years of collective experience of helping people from all over the world to find a way to grow. Every tool we will give you is one we have been trained in, experienced and used ourselves. Different people need different approaches and different tools and as such we have a full range of them ready for you. Here are some frameworks and approaches we select from:**Enneagram, Integral Theory, Spiral Dynamics, Scenario Planning, Systemic and Family constellations, Linguistic Ontology, Theory U, Embodied Leadership, Transformation Coaching, Transpersonal Design, Shadow work, Mindfulness, Integral Life Practice, Healthy Lifestyle, Integral Yoga and Visualisation.**
