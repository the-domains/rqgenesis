**TO CREATE SUSTAINABLE VALUE LEADERS NEED TO UPGRADE THEIR INNER OPERATING SYSTEM AND LEARN HOW TO INNOVATE FROM THE FUTURE.**

_"We are a young species who, uncertain of our niche, has very recently -- in a virtual second of life's day on Earth -- expanded to fill the world. In a sense we are like teenagers, full of enthusiasm and energy, and more than a bit confused. And, like every teenager must, we are about to discover that we are not the center of the universe -- not even the center of life on this planet. We are but one of millions and our merit depends not on our ego, but on our contribution."_ ~ Peter Senge, The Necessary Revolution

THE 3 CAPACITIES REQUIRED TO CREATE INTEGRATED SUSTAINABLE VALUE

1. **Integral Approach** - Our behaviours and collective systems we are part of originate in our individual mindsets and enacted collective cultures. To create different results as individuals and in our organisations, we therefore need to first upgrade the individual and collective spaces from which we operate. The **'Integral Framework'** is the most comprehensive lens through which we can perceive reality. Its use ensures all layers of reality are impacted and radically increases the effectiveness of our interventions.
2. **Inner Evolution** - We guide leaders to develop a completely new inner capacity which we call **'Rapture Intelligence'**. It allows them to create value aligned with life, elegantly and with joy. Leaders acting from this inner paradigm can effectively integrate and 'embody' physical, cognitive, emotional and spiritual intelligences to produce radically better outcomes. Find below the RQ definition as well as Barrett Brown's PhD study looking at how leaders with latest levels of conscious development design and engage in complex change initiatives.
3. **Innovating from the Future** - Traditional way to create value is based on past extrapolations and future predictions grounded in linear thinking. For exponential times, we need a different process. Theory U is a systemic innovation process (Otto Scharmer) to generate solutions 'from the future'. By bringing the entire 'system in the room' and fully utilizing the newly embodied **'RQ'** capacities, we create radical innovations aligned with the future waiting to happen.
